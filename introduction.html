    ---Web Site Purpose
    Information, knowledge diffusion, function/process management

    ---Web Site Composition (Wikipedia)
    It is a collection of related web pages, including multimedia content, 
    typically identified with a common domain name, and published on 
    at least one web server. Notable examples are wikipedia.org, google.com, 
    and amazon.com.

    ---Web Site Design (https://www.websitebuilderexpert.com/designing-websites/)
    Step 1: Create a project plan
        Ask these four questions:
        -What kind of brand do you want to build? Grab a pen and paper and write down adjectives that describe your brand.
        -What would success look like? Are you trying to make sales? Promote a brand? Or just have a bit of fun?
        -What kind of features do you need? These could be newsletter sign-up and social media buttons. When you choose a website-building platform (step 2), you need to know it has the features you want.
        -Who is your site for? Think about your future audience. What will they want to find?
        Your site should reflect the answers to these questions. For example, if you need a formal and professional site, you’ll want serious colors like white and grey. We’ve got more on this later.
        Going through this process also helps you avoid designing in the wrong direction.
        Next, conduct competitor research. Look at sites similar to your’s. What do you like? What do you not like? Get some inspiration. This is a key step in learning how to design a website.
    Step 2: Pick a platform to build your site.
        -Will it be a hosted website or a site installed on your personal or corporate server.
        -Will it be deisgned by someone else, you with help from an automated agent like WIX or made by your hand.
    Step 3: Homepage
        Your homepage is like your shop window, so it’s pretty important you take the time to get it right.
        It should leave visitors in no doubt what your site is about.
        Good websites are more than just a pretty face. They have to work. A good website delivers style, but also substance.
        An effective homepage makes it easy for visitors to navigate around your site.
        It should be clear what action you expect the visitor to take.
        -Logo
            Blazon, crest, coat of arms ('oekosemon')
        -Homepage layout
            Simplicity: less is more. Don’t let your site become cluttered or overly complicated. Communicate the core message of your site.
            On a simple level, a homepage has two parts: above and below the fold.
            When laying out your homepage, you need to think about what to put in each section.
            -Above the fold = the top half of the page. 
                Content placed here should be important because your visitor will not have to scroll down to see it.
                For example, one sentence summarising the value your site adds and a bold call to action linking through to your top conversion point (a newsletter sign-up, for example).
                Make the language on your CTA very specific and action-driven.
            -Below the fold = More in-depth content that supports the above-the-fold material.
                For example, a ‘benefits list’. If you’re an artist, this list explains why a visitor should use you.
                Other secondary content could be trust indicators like reviews.
        -Homepage navigation
            Knowing how to design a website navigation that works involves:
                Only adding necessary pages.
                Building categories of related links.
                Making sure page titles are short and clear.
                Ensuring the navigation bar is easily visible.
                Each section of your navigation needs to have a clear end goal for the user.
                Be specific in your titles. For example, ‘shop retro socks’ instead of ‘our products’.
                Don’t overload your visitors with too many options. This will lead to choice paralysis.
                Most websites place the navigation bar at the top of the page. We recommend you do the same.
                You don’t need to reinvent the wheel. This is where web users expect to find the navigation.
                Make sure you include links to Contact and About Us pages and an FAQ page. 
                This will also save you time answering one-to-one inquiries.
                When you’re finished, show your homepage to your friends and family. 
                Ask them what they think. If they find your site confusing, go back to the drawing board.
                You design your layout and navigation by moving elements around your template.
    Step 4: Choose a theme / template
        -Most templates will come with a pre-designed header.
        -They can contain images, galleries and even videos.
        -Don’t jump for the flashiest option.
        -Select a header you can work with, that will communicate your site’s core message.
        -There are lots of different types of header. Each is good for different types of site.
        -The safest choice is a static header image with content. You get key elements including:
            Headline.
            Main paragraph.
            CTA (buttons or text links through to a main conversion point, for example a checkout).
            Supporting image.
            More complex sites that advertise multiple products or services might want a slideshow header.
    Step 5: Choose a color scheme
        85% of shoppers say color is a key reason they buy a particular product, according to https://www.businessinsider.com/psych-101-for-your-website-the-color-factor-2011-7?IR=T.
        Understand the meaning of colors before choosing one.
        Red, for example, evokes passion and urgency. It attracts impulsive shoppers and is effective for fast food and clearance sales.
        Picking a kaleidoscope of bright, happy colors if you’re an online mortgage advisory service would be like turning up to a funeral in bright Hawaiian shorts. It’s just not appropriate.
        Whatever color palette you choose, it’s very important to remain consistent.
        Don’t have different color schemes on different pages. Your visitors will just get confused.
    Step 6: Add your content: fonts, images and content
        Fonts
            The golden rule of fonts is: never sacrifice readability for style.
            What’s the point in a great font if no one can read the words?
        Images
            Images are how you turn a modest website into a visual feast.
        Content
            Your site’s content should be more than just window dressing.
            It has to serve a purpose and encourage your visitor to complete an action.
    Step 7: Test, publish and update
        Before you publish, you need to test that your designs actually work.
        Your site needs to function just as well on a mobile as it does on desktop.
        It needs to be as enjoyable to browse on Google as on Firefox.
        Don’t rely on yourself to be designer, writer and editor all at once.
        Ask friends and family to test drive your website before it goes live.
        Update your website regularly!
        The landscape of website design is constantly shifting.
