        <p>Bootstrap is a free front-end framework for faster and easier web development</p>
        <p>Bootstrap includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation,
            modals, image carousels and many other, as well as optional JavaScript plugins</p>
        <p>Bootstrap also gives you the ability to easily create responsive designs</p>
        <p>What is Responsive Web Design? Responsive web design is about creating web sites which automatically adjust
            themselves to look good on all devices, from small phones to large desktops.</p>
