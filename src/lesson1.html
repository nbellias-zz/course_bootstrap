                <h3>Where to Get Bootstrap 4?</h3>
                <p>Include Bootstrap 4 from a CDN</p>
                <p>Download Bootstrap 4 from getbootstrap.com</p>
            </div>

                <h3>One advantage of using the Bootstrap 4 CDN:</h3>
                <p>Many users already have downloaded Bootstrap 4 from MaxCDN when visiting another site. </p>
                <p>As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site, which leads to faster loading time. Also, most CDN's will make sure that once a user requests a file from it, it will be served from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-2">
                <h3>jQuery and Popper?</h3>
                <p>Bootstrap 4 use jQuery and Popper.js for JavaScript components (like modals, tooltips, popovers etc).</p>
                <p>However, if you just use the CSS part of Bootstrap, you don't need them.</p>
